# What does this code do?

Gets all available products' information from Cruz Verde and Farmatodo. From each product the following information is stored: 

1. INVIMA code: this code is universal for all products in Colombia, so this will allow to compare products from differente companies in which the name can be slightly different. 
2. Price. 
3. html: in case there are inconsistencies in the information that require direct verification. 

**Once I finish uploading the repo this code WILL NOT BE MANTAINED**.
